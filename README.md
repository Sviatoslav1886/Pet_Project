# Pet_Project

### Briefly about each project:
1. [This assembly code](https://github.com/Sviatoslav1886/Pet_Project/blob/main/Arithmetic_expression_to_file.asm) calculates the expression F=(g+h)âˆ’(i+j) and performs file I/O operations using Linux system calls. The code first computes the sum of g and h, and the sum of i and j, then subtracts the latter from the former to obtain the result stored in F. It then opens a file specified by file_name, writes the value of F to this file, closes the file, and finally displays the value of F on the console followed by a newline character.
2.[This assembly code snippet](https://github.com/Sviatoslav1886/Pet_Project/blob/main/Arithmetic_%D0%BEperations.asm) demonstrates basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) using x86 instructions. Specifically, it performs two operations: adding the values stored in memory locations B and C and then subtracting the value in memory location E from the result. The results are stored in variables A and D, respectively. The code uses Linux system calls (int 0x80) to output the results to the console. This example is useful for understanding low-level operations and system calls in assembly language, illustrating how to manipulate memory and perform arithmetic operations.
